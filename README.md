# Linear Transformations – Vector & Image Transformations

## 📌 Description
This repository contains Python implementations of **linear transformations** applied to both **vectors** and **images**.  
The project demonstrates how transformations work mathematically using **NumPy** and applies them visually using **OpenCV**.

A **linear transformation** is a mapping `T: V → W` between two vector spaces that preserves the operations of **vector addition** and **scalar multiplication**.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Perform **vector-based linear transformations** using matrices.
- Apply transformations like **scaling**, **rotation**, **shearing**, and **translation**.
- Use **OpenCV** to visualize the effect of transformations on images.
- Beginner-friendly, modular, and clean implementation.

## 🛠️ Implemented Transformations

### **1. Vector Transformations**
A linear transformation `T` can be represented as:
\[
T(v) = A \cdot v
\]
Where:
- **v** → Input vector  
- **A** → Transformation matrix  
- **T(v)** → Transformed vector

Examples:
- Scaling vectors
- Rotating vectors
- Shearing vectors

### **2. Image Transformations**
Using **OpenCV** and **NumPy**, the following transformations are implemented:
- **Translation** → Shifting images by `(x, y)`
- **Rotation** → Rotating around the origin or image center
- **Scaling** → Resizing images proportionally
- **Affine Transformations** → Applying combined transformations
